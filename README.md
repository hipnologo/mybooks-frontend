# MyBooks Frontend

MyBooks Frontend is a web application built with React that allows users to manage a book library. The application uses React Router for managing routes and Axios for making HTTP requests to a REST API that manages books. The BookService class is used to simplify the interaction with the API by wrapping Axios. Authentication and authorization are required by the REST API, and the application uses environment variables to store the required user and password.

In addition to the book management functionality, the application also includes a header, footer, and hamburger menu components for easy navigation.
